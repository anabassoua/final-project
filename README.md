# Movie Finder ðŸŽ¥

## ðŸ¦‰ About my Project

Movie Finder is a full-stack project using MERN and The Movie Database API.
It gives you the ability to search through a large catalog of movies either by differents genres or by
using the search bar. The website also uses Auth0 API which helps users to get connected in order to add our favorites
movies to our unique and personnalized watchlist.
